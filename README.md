- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TPO911 - Tommy
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in further exploring Open Cobol.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning using Open Cobol IDE 4.7.6 but got several messages that hinders my running the programs I have created.
I have used cobol since 1970 : RM Cobol, Microsoft Cobol and lately since 2015 I am using IsCobol from Veryant.
I am trying to convert my application to Open Cobol )not using my IsCobol sources but RM Cobol.
So far I am not able to overcome the problem with "Redirection is not supported"
Best regards,
Tommy
